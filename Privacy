# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 10/2/2025
**Last Updated:** 10/2/2025

This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you log in with Discord.

## 1. Information We Collect

When you log in via Discord OAuth2, we receive:

* Your Discord user ID (required).
* Your Discord username and discriminator (may be retrieved but not always stored).

We do **not** collect your email, friends list, or other Discord data.
We do **not** ask for additional scopes beyond `identify`.

## 2. How We Use Information

* To verify your identity and authorize access.
* To issue a short-lived session token (JWT).
* To check if you are on the list of authorized users.

## 3. Data Retention

* We do not permanently store your data in databases, except where technically necessary for logs or security.
* Logs may include your Discord ID for debugging/security but are not shared.

## 4. Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties.
Your data may be shared with Discord solely for the purpose of OAuth authentication.

## 5. Security

We use standard security practices (HMAC-SHA256 signed JWTs, HTTPS, Cloudflare environment security).
No method of transmission is 100% secure, but we take reasonable measures to protect your information.

## 6. Your Rights

You may request deletion of any logged information tied to your account by contacting us.

## 7. Changes

We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
